This is a practice on my Repo to try and build and run an app for posting Articles of any kind
Though it's still under construction and needs alot of work on it but eventually will be up and running.

The Flask app  will enable users create accounts and post their articles on the app.
 1. Home page - welcomes a user to the app with some details about it.
 2. About page - explains what the app does.
 3. Register form - lets the user enter his/her credentials to create account.
 4. Login form - lets the user enter his/her to access an account.
 
ToDo: Form Validation, Backend Integration, Add Article.

Running the app on your machine

run git clone https://github.com/mmosoroohh/practice1 or download zip file.
- create virtualenv venv .
- run pip install -r requirements.txt
- run python app.py in your terminal/command prompt to view app on your broswer.
